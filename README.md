## Usage

`react-hook-form-subscribe` exposes a single hook, `useCreateFormSubscribe`, that allows you to subscribe to changes on any controlled form field.

### `useCreateFormSubscribe`
`useCreateFormSubscribe` takes a single argument, the `control` object from `react-hook-form`. It returns a function that you can use to subscribe to changes on the form fields.

Arguments
- `control` (`Object`): The `control` object from `react-hook-form`.
Return value
- `useFormSubscribe` (`Function`): A function that you can use to subscribe to changes on the form fields.
```tsx
import { useCreateFormSubscribe } from 'react-hook-form-subscribe';
...
const useFormSubscribe = useCreateFormSubscribe(control);
```

### `useFormSubscribe`
`useFormSubscribe` is a the returned function from `useCreateFormSubscribe` that you can use to subscribe to changes on the form fields. It takes two arguments: the name of the field you want to subscribe to, and a callback function that will be called when the field changes.

Arguments
- `name` (`String` | `Array`): The name of the field you want to subscribe to. You can pass a single field name as a string, or an array of field names.
- `callback` (`Function`): A callback function that will be called when the field changes. The callback function will be passed the new value of the field.

```tsx
useFormSubscribe('firstname', (firstname) => console.log(firstname));
useFormSubscribe(['firstname', 'lastname'], ([firstname, lastname]) =>
  console.log(firstname, lastname)
);
```

In the example above, we subscribe to changes on the `firstname` field and log the new value to the console. We also subscribe to changes on the `firstname` and `lastname` fields and log their new values to the console.
